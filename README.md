# ACL-Powershell-Enumeration
This is a Powershell Script I wrote to enumerate the access control lists of the files & sub-directories in the current working directory. 
Disclaimer-I used research and pieces of other scripts to build this script on my own. Any similarities between already written scripts is purely coincidental.
